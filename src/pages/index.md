# Roberto Alarcon

**Software Engineer**

I am a full-stack software engineer with 10+ years of experience based in San Diego, California. I currently work with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL Server, Postgres, MongoDB, .NET, and C#. I have a strong understanding of the full software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and analysis to design, implementation, testing, and deployment. I am also proficient in Agile methodologies and have experience working in a high-quality, collaborative environment.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a passion for technology. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
